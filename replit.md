# Bristol Site Intelligence Platform

## Recent Critical Updates

### Elite MCP Superserver Implementation (2025-08-17)
**ELITE MCP SUPERSERVER v2.0 DEPLOYED WITH ELEVENLABS INTEGRATION** - Comprehensive superserver architecture providing "the most capable data collector and analyzer the world has ever seen". Now serving 19+ verified tools across 7 categories (bristol, analysis, data, ai, memory, integration, utility) with seamless context sharing between all agents. Features shared memory banks for cross-agent synchronization, production-ready reliability with elite circuit breaker patterns, and comprehensive tool access without permission restrictions. Primary model: Claude 4.1 Opus via OpenRouter with intelligent fallbacks. **ElevenLabs MCP Integration Completed**: Properly implemented both SSE and STREAMABLE_HTTP transport types following ElevenLabs MCP specification exactly. Endpoints: /api/mcp/stream (STREAMABLE_HTTP - recommended), /api/mcp/sse (Server-Sent Events), /api/mcp/elevenlabs (legacy webhook). All endpoints tested and verified working with proper JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol implementation. Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL - Ready for ElevenLabs agent integration with auto-approval policy and 19 tools immediately available for Cap personality.

### ElevenLabs ConvAI Widget Integration (2025-08-17)
**ELEVENLABS CONVAI WIDGET COMPLETED** - Successfully integrated ElevenLabs ConvAI widget using React SDK (@elevenlabs/react package) with comprehensive fallback system. Widget implemented as React component in client/src/components/ElevenLabsWidget.tsx and globally integrated via App.tsx for all authenticated pages. Agent ID: agent_8801k2t62y9qehhsqqdmzmp10kt9. Features robust error handling with Bristol-branded fallback widget when SDK fails, positioned in bottom-right corner with Bristol corporate styling (Bristol maroon/gold gradient). Includes troubleshooting alerts and graceful degradation for network connectivity issues.

### Market Intelligence Integration Completed (2025-08-17)
**LIVE PERPLEXITY SONAR DEEP RESEARCH INTEGRATION** - Successfully connected market intelligence agent to OpenRouter API using Perplexity Sonar Deep Research model. System now automatically searches for real market intelligence every 2 hours and populates the Live Intelligence feed with authentic Federal Reserve policy updates, population migration trends, and construction cost analysis. Real-time data collection confirmed working with Bristol-specific business implications.

### WebSocket Performance Issue Resolved (2025-08-15)
**URGENT WebSocket Performance Issue Resolved** - Fixed critical WebSocket auto-reconnection loop that was causing performance degradation and console spam. Key changes: disabled aggressive 2-second reconnection timers, made WebSocket optional for core functionality, added manual reconnect option with visual status indicator. Core chat functionality now works reliably without WebSocket dependency.

## Overview
The Bristol Site Intelligence Platform is an enterprise-grade, AI-powered real estate development analysis tool. It is designed for multifamily development opportunities within Sunbelt markets. The platform provides comprehensive site analytics, interactive mapping, a proprietary 100-point Bristol scoring methodology, and real-time market intelligence. A key feature is the integrated AI assistant, Bristol A.I. Elite v5.0, which functions as a Fortune 500-grade always-on "boss agent" for advanced deal analysis with full-screen cyberpunk/glassomorphic interface. The platform aims to provide institutional-quality real estate analysis capabilities, supporting decisions related to IRR, NPV, cap rates, and LP/GP structures.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
**CRITICAL BRANDING PREFERENCE:** Dark Bristol header/nav with gold logo in top right corner must NEVER be changed - user has requested this multiple times and styling should remain consistent.
**THEME PREFERENCE:** All pages created should use light theme by default, not dark themes. Only the header/navigation should remain dark with Bristol branding. The chat interface specifically should use light backgrounds with chrome metallic styling but in light colors - no dark backgrounds anywhere except the Bristol header/nav.
**AI AGENT IDENTITY:** Bristol A.I. Elite now uses updated professional identity: "I'm the Bristol Site Intelligence AI â€“ the proprietary AI intelligence system engineered exclusively for Bristol Development Group. Drawing on over three decades of institutional real estate expertise, I underwrite deals, assess markets, and drive strategic decisions for Bristol Development projects. Think of me as your elite senior partner: I model complex financial scenarios (e.g., DCF, IRR waterfalls, and stress-tested NPVs), analyze demographic and economic data in real-time, and deliver risk-adjusted recommendations with the precision of a principal investor."
**FOOTER REQUIREMENT:** All pages must include thick Bristol footers to provide scroll room for the floating Bristol AI button - user has specifically requested this for optimal UX with the floating widget.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
