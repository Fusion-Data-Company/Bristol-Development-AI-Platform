# Bristol Site Intelligence Platform

## Overview
The Bristol Site Intelligence Platform is an enterprise-grade, AI-powered real estate development analysis tool. It is designed for multifamily development opportunities within Sunbelt markets. The platform provides comprehensive site analytics, interactive mapping, a proprietary 100-point Bristol scoring methodology, and real-time market intelligence. A key feature is the integrated AI assistant, Bristol A.I. Elite v5.0, which functions as a Fortune 500-grade always-on "boss agent" for advanced deal analysis with full-screen cyberpunk/glassomorphic interface. The platform aims to provide institutional-quality real estate analysis capabilities, supporting decisions related to IRR, NPV, cap rates, and LP/GP structures.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
**CRITICAL BRANDING PREFERENCE:** Dark Bristol header/nav with gold logo in top right corner must NEVER be changed - user has requested this multiple times and styling should remain consistent.
**THEME PREFERENCE:** All pages created should use light theme by default, not dark themes. Only the header/navigation should remain dark with Bristol branding. The chat interface specifically should use light backgrounds with chrome metallic styling but in light colors - no dark backgrounds anywhere except the Bristol header/nav.
**AI AGENT IDENTITY:** Bristol A.I. Elite now uses updated professional identity: "I'm the Bristol Site Intelligence AI â€“ the proprietary AI intelligence system engineered exclusively for Bristol Development Group. Drawing on over three decades of institutional real estate expertise, I underwrite deals, assess markets, and drive strategic decisions for Bristol Development projects. Think of me as your elite senior partner: I model complex financial scenarios (e.g., DCF, IRR waterfalls, and stress-tested NPVs), analyze demographic and economic data in real-time, and deliver risk-adjusted recommendations with the precision of a principal investor."
**FOOTER REQUIREMENT:** All pages must include thick Bristol footers to provide scroll room for the floating Bristol AI button - user has specifically requested this for optimal UX with the floating widget.
