EMERGENCY: CIRCUIT BREAKER IS WORKING BUT SOMETHING IS STILL CALLING IT IN A LOOP
The circuit breaker is correctly blocking requests, BUT something is repeatedly trying to call the demographics API even though it's disabled!
FIND AND KILL THE LOOP IMMEDIATELY:

SEARCH FOR THE CULPRIT:
Look for these patterns that would cause repeated calls:
javascript// BAD: useEffect without dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  fetchDemographics();
}); // <-- This runs on EVERY render!

// BAD: setInterval without cleanup
setInterval(() => {
  fetchDemographics();
}, 1000);

// BAD: Component re-rendering constantly

CHECK THESE SPECIFIC PLACES:

Any useEffect calling demographics without proper dependencies
Any setInterval or setTimeout in a loop
WebSocket message handlers triggering demographics fetch
Property analysis functions calling demographics repeatedly
Data visualization panels with auto-refresh


ADD THIS DEBUG CODE TO FIND THE CALLER:
javascript// In your ArcGIS API function, add stack trace
console.trace('ArcGIS called from:');
This will show you EXACTLY what's calling it repeatedly
LIKELY CULPRITS:

PropertyCard components - might fetch demographics on every render
Map components - might fetch for every property marker
Analytics dashboard - might have auto-refresh
Agent system - agents might be triggering demographic fetches
WebSocket handlers - might trigger on every message


FIX PATTERNS:
javascript// GOOD: useEffect with proper dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  if (propertyId && !demographicsData[propertyId]) {
    fetchDemographics(propertyId);
  }
}, [propertyId]); // Only runs when propertyId changes

// GOOD: Cleanup intervals
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    // code
  }, 60000); // Every minute, not every second
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval); // CLEANUP!
}, []);

// GOOD: Check before fetching
if (!isLoadingDemographics && !demographicsError) {
  fetchDemographics();
}

ADD RATE LIMITING:
javascriptconst lastFetchTime = useRef(0);
const MIN_FETCH_INTERVAL = 5000; // 5 seconds minimum

const fetchDemographics = () => {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (now - lastFetchTime.current < MIN_FETCH_INTERVAL) {
    console.log('Rate limited - too soon');
    return;
  }
  lastFetchTime.current = now;
  // ... actual fetch
};


IMMEDIATE ACTION:

Add console.trace() to find what's calling it
Check the browser DevTools Network tab - see what's triggering requests
Look for components that render frequently
Check for missing useEffect dependencies
Look for intervals without cleanup

THE CIRCUIT BREAKER MESSAGE SHOULD ONLY APPEAR 1-2 TIMES, NOT CONTINUOUSLY!
If it's appearing constantly, something is calling the API in a tight loop. This is killing your performance and memory.
DO NOT PROCEED WITH OTHER FIXES UNTIL THIS LOOP IS FOUND AND KILLED
