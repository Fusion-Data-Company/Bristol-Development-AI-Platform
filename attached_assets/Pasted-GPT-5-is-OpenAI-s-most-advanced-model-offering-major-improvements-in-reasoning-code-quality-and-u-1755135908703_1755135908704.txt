GPT-5 is OpenAIâ€™s most advanced model, offering major improvements in reasoning, code quality, and user experience. It is optimized for complex tasks that require step-by-step reasoning, instruction following, and accuracy in high-stakes use cases. It supports test-time routing features and advanced prompt understanding, including user-specified intent like "think hard about this." Improvements include reductions in hallucination, sycophancy, and better performance in coding, writing, and health-related tasks.

Note that BYOK is required for this model. Set up here: https://openrouter.ai/settings/integrations
