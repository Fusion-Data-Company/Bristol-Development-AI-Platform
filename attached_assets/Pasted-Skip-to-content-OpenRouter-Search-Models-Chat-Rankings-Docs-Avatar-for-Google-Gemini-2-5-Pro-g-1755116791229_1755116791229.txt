More models from Google
Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is a lightweight reasoning model in the Gemini 2.5 family, optimized for ultra-low latency and cost efficiency. It offers improved throughput, faster token generation, and better performance across common benchmarks compared to earlier Flash models. By default, "thinking" (i.e. multi-pass reasoning) is disabled to prioritize speed, but developers can enable it via the Reasoning API parameter to selectively trade off cost for intelligence.

Gemma 3n 2B
Gemma 3n E2B IT is a multimodal, instruction-tuned model developed by Google DeepMind, designed to operate efficiently at an effective parameter size of 2B while leveraging a 6B architecture. Based on the MatFormer architecture, it supports nested submodels and modular composition via the Mix-and-Match framework. Gemma 3n models are optimized for low-resource deployment, offering 32K context length and strong multilingual and reasoning performance across common benchmarks. This variant is trained on a diverse corpus including code, math, web, and multimodal data.

Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 05-20
Gemini 2.5 Flash May 20th Checkpoint is Google's state-of-the-art workhorse model, specifically designed for advanced reasoning, coding, mathematics, and scientific tasks. It includes built-in "thinking" capabilities, enabling it to provide responses with greater accuracy and nuanced context handling.

Note: This model is available in two variants: thinking and non-thinking. The output pricing varies significantly depending on whether the thinking capability is active. If you select the standard variant (without the ":thinking" suffix), the model will explicitly avoid generating thinking tokens.

To utilize the thinking capability and receive thinking tokens, you must choose the ":thinking" variant, which will then incur the higher thinking-output pricing.

Additionally, Gemini 2.5 Flash is configurable through the "max tokens for reasoning" parameter, as described in the documentation (https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#max-tokens-for-reasoning).
