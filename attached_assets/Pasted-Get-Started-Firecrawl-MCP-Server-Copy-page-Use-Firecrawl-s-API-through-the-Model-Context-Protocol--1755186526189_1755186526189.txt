​
Running on Cursor
Add Firecrawl MCP server to Cursor
​
Manual Installation
Configuring Cursor 🖥️ Note: Requires Cursor version 0.45.6+ For the most up-to-date configuration instructions, please refer to the official Cursor documentation on configuring MCP servers: Cursor MCP Server Configuration Guide
To configure Firecrawl MCP in Cursor v0.48.6
Open Cursor Settings
Go to Features > MCP Servers
Click ”+ Add new global MCP server”
Enter the following code:

Copy

Ask AI
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "YOUR-API-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
To configure Firecrawl MCP in Cursor v0.45.6
Open Cursor Settings
Go to Features > MCP Servers
Click ”+ Add New MCP Server”
Enter the following:
Name: “firecrawl-mcp” (or your preferred name)
Type: “command”
Command: env FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key npx -y firecrawl-mcp
If you are using Windows and are running into issues, try cmd /c "set FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key && npx -y firecrawl-mcp"
Replace your-api-key with your Firecrawl API key. If you don’t have one yet, you can create an account and get it from https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys
After adding, refresh the MCP server list to see the new tools. The Composer Agent will automatically use Firecrawl MCP when appropriate, but you can explicitly request it by describing your web scraping needs. Access the Composer via Command+L (Mac), select “Agent” next to the submit button, and enter your query.

​
Custom configuration with Claude Desktop
Add this to your claude_desktop_config.json:

Copy

Ask AI
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",

        "FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS": "5",
        "FIRECRAWL_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY": "2000",
        "FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY": "30000",
        "FIRECRAWL_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR": "3",

        "FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_WARNING_THRESHOLD": "2000",
        "FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD": "500"
      }
    }
  }
}
​
System Configuration
The server includes several configurable parameters that can be set via environment variables. Here are the default values if not configured:

Copy

Ask AI
const CONFIG = {
  retry: {
    maxAttempts: 3, // Number of retry attempts for rate-limited requests
    initialDelay: 1000, // Initial delay before first retry (in milliseconds)
    maxDelay: 10000, // Maximum delay between retries (in milliseconds)
    backoffFactor: 2, // Multiplier for exponential backoff
  },
  credit: {
    warningThreshold: 1000, // Warn when credit usage reaches this level
    criticalThreshold: 100, // Critical alert when credit usage reaches this level
  },
};
These configurations control:
Retry Behavior
Automatically retries failed requests due to rate limits
Uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API
Example: With default settings, retries will be attempted at:
1st retry: 1 second delay
2nd retry: 2 seconds delay
3rd retry: 4 seconds delay (capped at maxDelay)
Credit Usage Monitoring
Tracks API credit consumption for cloud API usage
Provides warnings at specified thresholds
Helps prevent unexpected service interruption
Example: With default settings:
Warning at 1000 credits remaining
Critical alert at 100 credits remaining
​
Rate Limiting and Batch Processing
The server utilizes Firecrawl’s built-in rate limiting and batch processing capabilities:
Automatic rate limit handling with exponential backoff
Efficient parallel processing for batch operations
Smart request queuing and throttling
Automatic retries for transient errors
​
