IN MEMORIAM

ON NOVEMBER 15, 2019, A FOUNDING PARTNER AND FRIEND, DAN DANIEL, PASSED AWAY FROM A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED CARDIAC TRAUMA.  
It is often said that a person was "one of a kind," but in Dan's case, no truer words have been spoken.   We will honor Dan by continuing to build the legacy he helped start and lead for more than 20 years at Bristol.  We will strive for everything we do in the future to represent the hard work and immense fun that Dan poured into everything he did. 

OPPORTUNITY AWAITS.
