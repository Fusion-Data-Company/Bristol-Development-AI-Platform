Your latest update claims complete white-label transformation. Verify this claim by showing me ACTUAL PROOF without executing anything. I need to see the evidence.
SHOW ME THE ACTUAL CODE/FILES:
1. GREP VERIFICATION - Run and show full output:
bash# Show me EXACTLY what these commands return:
grep -r -i "bristol" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git --exclude="*.bak" | head -20
grep -r "BDG" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git | head -10
2. SHOW ME THESE SPECIFIC FILES (first 20 lines of each):

 teamSeeder.ts - Were 22 Bristol emails really changed?
 .env.example - Is Bristol branding really gone?
 Chat.tsx - Is the Bristol logo import really updated?
 Any file that previously had /api/bristol-brain endpoint

3. LIST RENAMED FILES:
bash# Show me what's in the services directory now:
ls -la server/services/
ls -la client/public/ | grep -E "(logo|social)"
ls -la client/src/assets/
4. DATABASE SCHEMA PROOF:
Show me any file containing these terms to prove the changes:

 Search for "companyScore" (should exist)
 Search for "bristolScore" (should NOT exist)
 Search for "companyImplication" (should exist)
 Search for "bristolImplication" (should NOT exist)

5. CRITICAL VERIFICATION:
bash# These should return ZERO results if truly complete:
find . -name "*bristol*" -type f ! -path "*/node_modules/*" ! -path "*/.git/*"
find . -type f -exec grep -l "@bristol.dev" {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules
find . -type f -exec grep -l "bristoldevelopment.com" {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules
6. TRANSFORMATION EVIDENCE:
For each claim you made, show me the proof:

"bristol variants â†’ branded variants" - Show me a UI component with this change
"46 properties worth $2.8B maintained" - Show me where this data lives now
"APIs responding with new structure" - Show me an API route file

SUMMARY REQUIREMENT:
Based on the original requirement of removing 3,247+ Bristol references across 78 critical files, provide:

BEFORE count: 3,247+ Bristol references
AFTER count: [Show me the actual number from grep]
Files modified: [Show me the actual count]
Any Bristol references that still exist: [List with file:line]

Don't tell me it's done - PROVE it's done with actual file contents and command outputs.
