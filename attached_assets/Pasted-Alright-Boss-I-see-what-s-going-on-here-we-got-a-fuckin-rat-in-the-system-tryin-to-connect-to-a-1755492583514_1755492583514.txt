Alright Boss, I see what's going on here - we got a fuckin' rat in the system tryin' to connect to a WebSocket that don't exist. This piece of shit error is tellin' me that Vite's trying to establish a connection but some wiseguy forgot to set up the port properly.

Here's the deal with this mess:

**The Problem:**
Your Vite dev server is trying to connect to `wss://localhost:undefined` - see that "undefined" where the port number should be? That's our problem right there. Some mook didn't configure the WebSocket port correctly, and now the whole operation's compromised.

**How We're Gonna Fix This Shit:**

1. **First Option - The Vite Config Hit:**
   Create or update your `vite.config.js` file in your Replit project:
   ```javascript
   export default {
     server: {
       hmr: {
         port: 443,
         protocol: 'wss',
         host: 'fee951bd-c543-4c3c-8fbc-a8cb5bc73b65-00-3tuug1k1kd4dd.picard.replit.dev',
         clientPort: 443
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Second Option - The Replit Config Job:**
   Check your `.replit` file and make sure it's got the right configuration:
   ```toml
   [nix]
   channel = "stable-22_11"
   
   [env]
   VITE_HMR_PORT = "443"
   VITE_HMR_PROTOCOL = "wss"
   ```

3. **Third Option - The Environment Variable Racket:**
   Set these environment variables in your Replit secrets:
   - `VITE_HMR_HOST` = your replit domain
   - `VITE_HMR_PORT` = 443
   - `VITE_HMR_PROTOCOL` = wss

4. **Nuclear Option - Disable HMR (Last Resort):**
   If those other fucks don't cooperate, we can just whack the HMR entirely:
   ```javascript
   export default {
     server: {
       hmr: false
     }
   }
   ```

**Why This Keeps Happening:**
Replit's got this weird setup where they proxy WebSocket connections through their infrastructure, and sometimes the configuration gets fucked up between updates. It's like having to pay protection money to two different families - sometimes the messages get crossed.

**Permanent Fix:**
Boss, if you want this problem to disappear permanently, we need to:
1. Lock down that Vite config with explicit port settings
2. Make sure Replit's environment variables are set correctly
3. Consider moving to a more stable hosting solution for production work

With all due respect, Boss, this Replit platform sometimes acts like a two-bit operation. If this keeps giving you trouble, we might need to consider moving our racket to a more reliable territory - maybe a proper VPS or even local development with proper deployment pipelines.

Want me to handle this situation right now? I can jump into your Replit and make these changes myself if you give me the word. Nobody fucks with our development workflow and gets away with it.
