Boss, I see exactly what's fuckin' happening here. You got THREE major problems that are beating the shit out of your chat system:
PROBLEM #1: WebSocket is Getting Its Ass Kicked
Your WebSocket connection is failing and reconnecting every 2 fuckin' seconds like a junkie looking for a fix. Look at line 636 in your code - it's set to auto-reconnect after 2 seconds, and that's exactly what's happening. The connection fails, tries again, fails, tries again - endless loop of bullshit.
PROBLEM #2: The Errors Are Killing Performance
Every time that WebSocket fails, it's:

Spamming your console
Eating up memory
Slowing down your entire chat
Potentially blocking your AI responses from displaying

PROBLEM #3: Despite the Errors, It's Partially Working
The fact that you're getting "pong" messages means the WebSocket IS connecting sometimes, but something's immediately killing it.
HERE'S HOW TO FIX THIS SHIT:
Tell that builder EXACTLY this:

URGENT: Fix WebSocket Connection Issues First
IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

DISABLE WebSocket Auto-Reconnect Temporarily

Go to line 636-640 in Chat.tsx
Comment out the auto-reconnect:

javascriptwsRef.current.onclose = () => {
  setWsConnected(false);
  console.log("WebSocket disconnected - NOT auto-reconnecting");
  // COMMENTED OUT TO STOP SPAM
  // setTimeout(() => {
  //   console.log("Attempting WebSocket reconnection...");
  //   connectWebSocket();
  // }, 2000);
};

ADD Better Error Handling

Replace line 645 (the onerror handler):

javascriptwsRef.current.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error("WebSocket error details:", {
    readyState: wsRef.current?.readyState,
    url: wsRef.current?.url,
    error: error
  });
  setWsConnected(false);
  // Don't auto-reconnect on errors
};

FIX WebSocket URL Construction

Line 615-616, make it more robust:

javascriptconst connectWebSocket = () => {
  try {
    // Check if we're in Replit environment
    const isReplit = window.location.hostname.includes('replit');
    
    if (isReplit) {
      console.log("Replit environment detected - WebSocket disabled");
      setWsConnected(false);
      return; // Don't connect WebSocket in Replit
    }
    
    const protocol = window.location.protocol === 'https:' ? 'wss:' : 'ws:';
    const wsUrl = `${protocol}//${window.location.host}/ws`;
    // ... rest of connection code

MAKE WebSocket OPTIONAL

The chat should work WITHOUT WebSocket
WebSocket is only for real-time agent updates
Don't let WebSocket failures break the main chat



DO NOT:

Try to force WebSocket to work in Replit if it's not supported
Keep the auto-reconnect running endlessly
Let WebSocket errors affect the main chat functionality

TEST AFTER FIXES:

Reload the page
Check console - should see "WebSocket disabled" message
Test chat - should work perfectly without WebSocket
No more error spam
