Listen up Boss, here's the copy-paste prompt for that Replit wise guy to analyze if the job was done clean:

COPY THIS AND PASTE INTO REPLIT:
I need you to perform a comprehensive audit of this codebase to verify if a white-label conversion from "Bristol Development Group" was completed correctly. DO NOT EXECUTE ANY CHANGES - only analyze and report.
Please check the following WITHOUT modifying any files:
1. VERIFICATION OF REPLACEMENTS
Search for any remaining instances of:

"Bristol Development Group" (all cases)
"Bristol Development"
"Bristol Dev Group"
"BristolDev"
"Bristol" (standalone)
"BDG" (as acronym)
"bristol" (lowercase in code/config)
Any bristol emails (@bristol*, @bristol)
Any bristol domains/URLs

Report: How many instances remain? In which files?
2. CHECK REPLACEMENT CONSISTENCY
Verify that replacements follow this pattern:

"Bristol Development Group" → "Your Company Name"
"Bristol" → "Your Company"
"bristol" → "yourcompany"
"BDG" → "YCN"

Are replacements consistent throughout?
3. FILE INTEGRITY CHECK
Without modifying, verify:

Do all import statements still resolve correctly?
Are there any broken file references after renaming?
Do configuration files still have valid JSON/YAML syntax?
Are there any obvious syntax errors from bad replacements?

4. FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS PRESERVED
Check that these weren't accidentally modified:

CSS class names that happened to contain "bristol"
Variable names critical to functionality
Third-party library references
API endpoint structures
Database field names that shouldn't change

5. ASSET VERIFICATION
List any files that need manual replacement:

Image files with Bristol branding
Logo files (bristol-logo.* → company-logo.*)
Favicon files
Any PDFs or documents

6. CRITICAL AREAS AUDIT
Specifically check these files/areas:

package.json (name, description, repository)
All .env files (API keys, service names)
HTML meta tags and titles
Email templates
Error messages and console outputs
Database migration files

7. REPORT POTENTIAL ISSUES
Identify any changes that might break functionality:

Renamed files that other services depend on
Changed API endpoints that external services use
Modified database schemas
Altered authentication/authorization logic
Changed webhook URLs or callbacks
