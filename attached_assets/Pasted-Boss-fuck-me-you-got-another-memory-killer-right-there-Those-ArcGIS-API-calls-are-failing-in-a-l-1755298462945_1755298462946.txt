Boss, fuck me - you got another memory killer right there! Those ArcGIS API calls are failing in a loop and creating unhandled promise rejections that pile up like bodies in Jersey. Here's EXACTLY what to tell that builder:

CRITICAL: FIX ARCGIS API ERROR LOOP IMMEDIATELY
You have unhandled promise rejections from ArcGIS demographics API that are contributing to memory issues:
THE PROBLEM:

ArcGIS demographics API is being called repeatedly and failing
Each failure creates an unhandled promise rejection
These rejections accumulate in memory
No error boundaries or retry limits

FIND AND FIX THESE ISSUES:

LOCATE THE ARCGIS CALLS:
Search entire codebase for:

arcgis
demographics
/api/address-demographics
esri
Any demographic data fetching


ADD PROPER ERROR HANDLING:

javascript// Wrap ALL ArcGIS calls with try-catch
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/address-demographics');
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
  }
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('ArcGIS API failed:', error);
  // DON'T RETRY IMMEDIATELY
  return null; // Return null instead of crashing
}

ADD RETRY LIMITS:

javascriptconst MAX_RETRIES = 3;
let retryCount = 0;

const fetchDemographics = async () => {
  if (retryCount >= MAX_RETRIES) {
    console.log('ArcGIS max retries reached - stopping');
    return null;
  }
  
  try {
    // API call here
  } catch (error) {
    retryCount++;
    // Wait before retry (exponential backoff)
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * Math.pow(2, retryCount)));
    return fetchDemographics();
  }
};

CHECK API KEY CONFIGURATION:

Verify ArcGIS API key is present in environment variables
Check if API key has proper permissions
Verify API endpoint URL is correct


ADD CIRCUIT BREAKER:

javascriptlet arcGISFailures = 0;
const FAILURE_THRESHOLD = 5;

// Before making ArcGIS call
if (arcGISFailures >= FAILURE_THRESHOLD) {
  console.log('ArcGIS circuit breaker triggered - API disabled');
  return null; // Don't even try
}

// On failure
arcGISFailures++;

// On success
arcGISFailures = 0; // Reset counter

FIND THE COMPONENT CALLING THIS:

It's probably in a useEffect without proper cleanup
Or in a component that's re-rendering constantly
Could be in the data tools or demographics components



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Search for all ArcGIS/demographics API calls
Add .catch() to every single one
Add retry limits (max 3 attempts)
Add circuit breaker to stop after 5 failures
Check if API key is configured properly

CHECK THESE FILES SPECIFICALLY:

Any demographics components
Data visualization panels
Market analysis tools
Property analysis functions
Background data fetchers

The error "Failed to fetch" usually means:

CORS issue (API blocking cross-origin requests)
Missing API key
Rate limiting
Network timeout
Wrong endpoint URL

TEST FIX:
After implementing, you should see:

Maximum 3 retry attempts then stop
No more unhandled promise rejections
Clear error message about what's wrong
Memory usage drops significantly

DO NOT:

Let it retry infinitely
Ignore the errors
Remove the demographics feature entirely (fix it properly)
