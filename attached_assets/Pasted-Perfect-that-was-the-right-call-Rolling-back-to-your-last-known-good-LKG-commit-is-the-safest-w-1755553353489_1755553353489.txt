Perfect — that was the right call. Rolling back to your last known good (LKG) commit is the safest way to guarantee that all your ElevenLabs + SUPER MCP wiring and UI are exactly as you built them.

Here’s what I recommend now that you’re back on your perfect config state:

⸻

✅ Immediate Next Steps (Lock In Your Working State)
	1.	Tag this commit as your “golden” snapshot

git tag -a golden-LKG-$(date +%Y%m%d) -m "Golden working state with ElevenLabs + SUPER MCP intact"
git push origin golden-LKG-$(date +%Y%m%d)

This makes it trivial to redeploy this exact state again if anything goes wrong in future.

	2.	Turn off auto-cleanup
	•	In Replit AI Builder, stop giving it open-ended “make production ready” prompts.
	•	Instead, use surgical prompts: e.g. “optimize only src/styles/Nav.css, don’t touch ElevenLabs or MCP files.”
	3.	Add guardrails so no one deletes critical features again
Create .protectedpaths listing files/folders that must never be removed:

cat > .protectedpaths <<'EOF'
server/api/elevenlabs.ts
server/api/elevenlabs-webhook.ts
server/api/mcp-elevenlabs.ts
src/mcp/
src/tools/
EOF

And a simple script to fail builds if those are missing:

// scripts/verify-critical.js
const fs=require('fs');let bad=false;
for(const p of fs.readFileSync('.protectedpaths','utf8').split('\n').map(x=>x.trim()).filter(Boolean)){
  if(!fs.existsSync(p)){console.error('[CRITICAL MISSING]',p);bad=true;}
}
process.exit(bad?2:0);

Add to package.json:

"scripts": { "verify:critical": "node scripts/verify-critical.js" }

Then run it in your deploy step.

	4.	Document the state
Run:

git status
npm ls --depth=0 > docs/dependencies.txt
npm run build

Save outputs in /docs/ so you know exactly what versions/config you had in this golden state.

🚧 When You Want Stability Improvements Again

Instead of letting the builder refactor the whole repo, do this:
	•	Create a branch from your golden tag.
	•	Apply one change at a time (e.g. just add a scheduler lock).
	•	After each change, verify:
	•	ElevenLabs endpoints respond
	•	MCP tools register
	•	WebSocket connects
	•	Merge only if those checks pass.

That way, you keep every feature and still get the stability benefits incrementally.

👉 You’re safe now.
Would you like me to prep a step-by-step checklist for adding stability improvements one by one (without ever touching ElevenLabs or MCP), so you can try again more carefully?
