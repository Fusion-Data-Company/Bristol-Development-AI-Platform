Technology (#6)
Grok 4 is xAI's latest reasoning model with a 256k context window. It supports parallel tool calling, structured outputs, and both image and text inputs. Note that reasoning is not exposed, reasoning cannot be disabled, and the reasoning effort cannot be specified. Pricing increases once the total tokens in a given request is greater than 128k tokens. See more details on the xAI docs

Sample code and API for Grok 4
OpenRouter normalizes requests and responses across providers for you.
Create API key
OpenRouter provides an OpenAI-compatible completion API to 400+ models & providers that you can call directly, or using the OpenAI SDK. Additionally, some third-party SDKs are available.

In the examples below, the OpenRouter-specific headers are optional. Setting them allows your app to appear on the OpenRouter leaderboards.

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",

More models from xAI
Grok 3 Mini
A lightweight model that thinks before responding. Fast, smart, and great for logic-based tasks that do not require deep domain knowledge. The raw thinking traces are accessible.

Grok 3
Grok 3 is the latest model from xAI. It's their flagship model that excels at enterprise use cases like data extraction, coding, and text summarization. Possesses deep domain knowledge in finance, healthcare, law, and science.

Grok 3 Mini Beta
Grok 3 Mini is a lightweight, smaller thinking model. Unlike traditional models that generate answers immediately, Grok 3 Mini thinks before responding. It’s ideal for reasoning-heavy tasks that don’t demand extensive domain knowledge, and shines in math-specific and quantitative use cases, such as solving challenging puzzles or math problems.

Transparent "thinking" traces accessible. Defaults to low reasoning, can boost with setting reasoning: { effort: "high" }

Note: That there are two xAI endpoints for this model. By default when using this model we will always route you to the base endpoint. If you want the fast endpoint you can add provider: { sort: throughput}, to sort by throughput instead.

Grok 3 Beta
Grok 3 is the latest model from xAI. It's their flagship model that excels at enterprise use cases like data extraction, coding, and text summarization. Possesses deep domain knowledge in finance, healthcare, law, and science.

Excels in structured tasks and benchmarks like GPQA, LCB, and MMLU-Pro where it outperforms Grok 3 Mini even on high thinking.
