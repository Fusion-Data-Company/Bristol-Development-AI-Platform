# Pre-Flight Audit Report - Bristol Development App
*Generated on: 2025-01-20*

## Executive Summary
This report documents the current state of the Bristol Development App before production hardening. The app is functionally complete with advanced MCP integration, comprehensive data processing, and multiple AI agent systems.

## 1. Dependency and Route Graph

### File Structure Analysis
- **Total TypeScript/JavaScript files**: 150+ files across client/server/shared
- **Client structure**: React app with component-based architecture
- **Server structure**: Express API with comprehensive service layer
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types

### Route Structure
**Protected API Routes**:
- `/api/mcp-*` - MCP tool orchestration endpoints
- `/api/webhooks/*` - External webhook handlers
- `/api/elevenlabs-webhook` - ElevenLabs integration

**Client Routes**:
- `/` - Main application dashboard
- `/chat` - AI chat interface
- `/sites` - Property management
- `/analytics` - Data analytics
- `/competitor-watch` - Competitor monitoring
- `/enterprise*` - Enterprise dashboards

## 2. Placeholder and Cleanup Findings

### Mock/Temporary Code Found
```
./client/src/components/analytics/MapWidget.tsx:  const mockSites: MapSite[] = [
./client/src/components/analytics/MapWidget.tsx:  const displaySites = sites.length > 0 ? sites : mockSites;
```
**Status**: Acceptable - Mock data used as fallback for demonstration

### ArcGIS Service Issues
```
./client/src/components/analytics/ArcGISLayer.tsx:        setError('ArcGIS service temporarily disabled due to repeated failures');
```
**Status**: Production issue requiring attention

### No TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER Issues
- Comprehensive scan showed minimal placeholder content
- Most mock data appears to be intentional fallbacks

## 3. Asset Inventory

### Attached Assets (Not in production bundle)
- **Total**: 80+ attached files in `attached_assets/`
- **Type**: Documentation, prompts, and reference materials
- **Status**: Safe to keep, not affecting production build

### No Critical Asset Issues Found
- No oversized assets detected
- No unused public assets found

## 4. MCP & Webhook Integrity Check

### MCP Files (PROTECTED - DO NOT MODIFY)
- `server/api/mcp-*.ts` - Core MCP endpoints
- `server/services/mcp*.ts` - MCP service layer
- `server/routes/mcpDatabaseValidation.ts` - Database validation
- `server/mcp-postgres-server.*` - PostgreSQL MCP server
- `mcp-config.json` - MCP configuration

### Webhook Files (PROTECTED - DO NOT MODIFY)
- `server/api/elevenlabs-webhook.ts` - ElevenLabs webhook handler

**Verification**: All MCP and webhook files are properly structured and should remain untouched.

## 5. Mobile Readiness Assessment

### Current Mobile Support
- **Pop-out agent**: Currently visible on all screen sizes
- **Navigation**: Desktop-oriented navigation
- **Chat interface**: Basic responsive design
- **Mobile UX**: Needs improvement for mobile-first experience

### Issues Identified
1. No mobile navigation system
2. Pop-out agent should be hidden on mobile
3. Need responsive breakpoints for mobile optimization
4. Chat interface needs mobile UX enhancements

## 6. Build Settings Verification

### Current Configuration
- **Node version**: Using latest LTS
- **Build command**: `vite build && esbuild server/index.ts...`
- **Start command**: `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`
- **Dev command**: `NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts`

### Environment Variables
- Production environment variables properly configured
- No security issues with environment variable exposure

## 7. Security & Compliance Quick Pass

### Current Security Measures
- **CORS**: Configured in server
- **Helmet**: Security headers implemented
- **Session management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect

### Areas for Enhancement
- Need Content Security Policy headers
- Rate limiting could be improved
- Error responses need sanitization review

## Recommended Actions

### Priority 1 (Critical)
1. Implement mobile navigation system
2. Hide pop-out agent on mobile devices
3. Add Content Security Policy headers
4. Fix ArcGIS service stability issues

### Priority 2 (Important)
1. Create production logger service
2. Implement comprehensive error boundaries
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Optimize mobile chat interface

### Priority 3 (Enhancement)
1. Add service worker for caching
2. Implement image optimization
3. Add comprehensive accessibility features
4. Create operational documentation

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Mobile implementation won't affect existing functionality
- **Medium Risk**: CSP headers may need tuning for existing integrations
- **No Risk**: MCP and webhook systems are well-protected

## Next Steps
1. Begin mobile implementation following the production hardening plan
2. Implement mobile navigation and responsive design
3. Add production security headers
4. Conduct smoke testing on mobile devices
