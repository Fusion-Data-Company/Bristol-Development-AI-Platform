## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error
If you receive an access denied message, it means your email is not authorized. Contact your administrator to add your email to the whitelist.

### Can't Remember Password (Email Users)
Use the "Forgot password?" link on the Replit authentication page to reset your password.

### Google/Apple Sign-in Not Working
Ensure you're using the exact email address that was authorized. The system is case-insensitive but requires exact email match.
